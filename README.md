# AI Story Generator Assignment3
The AI Story Generator is an interactive storytelling application where users create a character, build a world, and select a genre such as Fantasy, Sci-Fi, or Mystery. The program then generates a branching narrative, allowing players to make choices that shape each chapter of the story. Users can customize writing style, story length, and complexity, and their finished stories can be saved, tagged, favorited, and exported. With optional AI image or voice features, the tool combines creativity with customization to deliver a personalized choose-your-own-adventure experience.


This project uses MVC architecture, the Strategy Pattern, the Factory Pattern, and the Singleton Pattern to ensure clean design and maintainability.
